# CBSE Question Quality Guidelines

## Universal Quality Requirements

Apply these guidelines to ALL CBSE question papers across classes and subjects:

### Ambiguity
- [ ] Unambiguous: Only one clear interpretation
- [ ] Specific wording: No vague terms (e.g., "some", "many")
- [ ] Clear scope: Parameters well-defined (ranges, conditions)

### Class Appropriateness
- [ ] Age-appropriate: Matches target class level
- [ ] Curriculum-aligned: Uses grade-level concepts/language
- [ ] Prior knowledge: Requires only expected class-level concepts

### Solvability
- [ ] Calculator-free: Calculations doable manually (unless specified)
- [ ] Time-appropriate: Fits within allocated time (see difficulty distribution)
- [ ] Step-by-step: Working shown is manageable

### Correctness
- [ ] Mathematically correct: No calculation errors
- [ ] Notation accurate: Standard CBSE mathematical/scientific notation
- [ ] Units correct: Proper units in quantity/measure problems
- [ ] Scientifically accurate: Concepts align with CBSE textbooks

### Language
- [ ] CBSE-style: Phrases and terminology consistent with CBSE practice
- [ ] Clear instructions: Unambiguous directions
- [ ] Professional: Tone appropriate for examination
- [ ] Concise: No unnecessary filler words

### Numerical Values
- [ ] Reasonable: Numbers should be realistic to context
- [ ] Manageable: Calculations should not require excessive steps
- [ ] Consistent: Use similar difficulty level across question paper
- [ ] No repetition: Avoid reusing same numbers in multiple questions

### Time Allocation
- [ ] Realistic: Students can complete within exam duration
- [ ] Balanced: Mix of quick and time-consuming questions
- [ ] Distributed: Easy/medium/hard times distributed proportionately

## CBSE Terminology Standards

Use standard CBSE terms and conventions consistently:

- **Mathematics**: "Find", "Prove", "Solve", "Calculate", "Show that", "Hence or otherwise"
- **Science**: "Explain", "Describe", "Compare", "Analyse", "Determine", "State"
- **English**: "Write", "Comprehension", "Analyse", "Interpret", "Express"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Wording Issues
- Avoid: "All of the following EXCEPT"
- Avoid: Ambiguous pronouns (it, they) with multiple antecedents
- Avoid: Conditional phrasing with unclear consequences

### Mathematical Issues
- Avoid: Overly complex fraction notation
- Avoid: Multiple nested radicals without parentheses
- Avoid: Contradictory constraints on variables

### Complexity Issues
- Avoid: Mixing too many concepts in one question
- Avoid: Excessive algebraic manipulation
- Avoid: Non-standard problem-solving approaches

## Quality Checklist Before Final Submission

Use this checklist for every question paper:

For Each Question:
- [ ] One clear interpretation
- [ ] Appropriate difficulty level
- [ ] CBSE-style language
- [ ] Correct notation and units
- [ ] Reasonable numerical values
- [ ] Time-appropriate complexity

For Overall Paper:
- [ ] Difficulty distribution: 40% easy, 40% medium, 20% hard
- [ ] Covers only blueprint chapters
- [ ] Total marks match blueprint
- [ ] Question counts per section match blueprint
- [ ] Internal choice rules followed
- [ ] No ambiguous questions
- [ ] Variety in question types
- [ ] No repetition of scenarios
- [ ] Balanced time allocation

## Error Prevention

When generating questions, always:
1. Double-check calculations
2. Verify mathematical/scientific accuracy
3. Ensure CBSE standards are followed
4. Check difficulty allocation
5. Review for ambiguity
6. Validate against blueprint constraints

## Reference Sources

When unsure about CBSE style:
- Consult NCERT textbooks for language patterns
- Review previous year papers for question style
- Refer to CBSE examination guidelines
- Use CBSE sample papers as templates
