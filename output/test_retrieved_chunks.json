          "text": "1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\nIn your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a\nproduct of its prime factors. For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 11 × 23, and so on.\nNow, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply\nsome or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).\nLet us list a few :\n7 × 11 × 23 = 1771\n3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 5313\n2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 10626\n23 × 3 × 73 = 8232\n22 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 21252\nand so on.\nNow, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.\nWhat is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite\nnumber of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,\nif we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite\ncollection of numbers, all\nthe primes and all possible\nproducts of primes. The\nquestion is – can we\nproduce all the composite\nnumbers this way? What\ndo you think? Do you\nthink that there may be a\ncomposite number which\nis not the product of\npowers\nof\nprimes?\nBefore we answer this,\nlet us factorise positive\nintegers, that is, do the\nopposite of what we have\ndone so far.\nWe are going to use\nthe factor tree with which\nyou are all familiar.

Thus, the zero of\nthe polynomial 2x + 3 is the\nx-coordinate of the point where the\ngraph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the\nx-axis.\nIn general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, the graph of y = ax + b is a\nstraight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely,\n, 0\nb\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nTherefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, has exactly one zero, namely, the\nx-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis.\nNow, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial.\nConsider the quadratic polynomial x2 – 3x – 4. Let us see what the graph* of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 looks like. Let us list  a few values of y = x2 – 3x – 4 corresponding to\na few values for x as given in Table 2.1.\n* Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students,\nnor is to be evaluated.\nFig. 2.1\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n13\nTable 2.1\nx\n– 2\n–1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\ny = x2 – 3x – 4\n6\n0\n– 4\n– 6\n– 6\n– 4\n0\n6\nIf we locate the points listed\nabove on a graph paper and draw\nthe graph, it will actually look like\nthe one given in Fig. 2.2.\nIn fact, for any quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the\ngraph of the corresponding\nequation y = ax2 + bx + c has one\nof the two shapes either open\nupwards like\nor open\ndownwards like\ndepending on\nwhether a > 0 or a < 0. (These\ncurves are called parabolas.)\nYou can see from Table 2.1\nthat –1 and 4 are zeroes of the\nquadratic polynomial. Also\nnote from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4\nare the x-coordinates of the points\nwhere the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4\nintersects the x-axis. Thus, the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nx2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of\nthe points where the graph of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 intersects the\nx-axis.\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the\nparabola representing  y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the\nfollowing three cases can happen:\nFig. 2.2\nReprint 2025-26\n14\nMATHEMATICS\nCase (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A.\nThe x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nax2 + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\nFig. 2.3\nCase (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident\npoints. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A\n(see Fig. 2.4).\nFig. 2.4\nThe x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c\nin this case.\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n15\nCase (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below\nthe x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\nFig. 2.5\nSo, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero in this case.\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two\ndistinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a\npolynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.\nNow, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic\npolynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. To see what\nthe graph of y = x3 – 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few\nvalues for x as shown in Table 2.2.\nTable 2.2\nx\n–2\n–1\n0\n1\n2\ny = x3 – 4x\n0\n3\n0\n–3\n0\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see\nthat the graph of y = x3 – 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\nReprint 2025-26\n16\nMATHEMATICS\nWe see from the table above\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the\ncubic polynomial x3 – 4x. Observe\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the\nx-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – 4x\nintersects the x-axis. Since the curve\nmeets the x-axis in only these 3\npoints, their x-coordinates are the\nonly zeroes of the polynomial.\nLet us take a few more\nexamples. Consider the cubic\npolynomials x3 and x3 – x2. We draw\nthe graphs of y = x3 and y = x3 – x2\nin Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.\nFig. 2.7\nFig. 2.8\nFig. 2.6\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n17\nNote that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x3. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see\nthat 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the\nx-axis. Similarly, since x3 – x2 = x2 (x – 1),  0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial\nx3 – x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – x2 intersects the x-axis.\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic\npolynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\nRemark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)\nintersects the x-axis at atmost n points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has\nat most n zeroes.",

We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)\n= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2x2 – 8x + 6 are 1 and 3.

By the\nmethod of splitting the middle term,\n3x2 + 5x – 2 = 3x2 + 6x – x – 2 = 3x(x + 2) –1(x + 2)\n= (3x – 1)(x + 2)\nHence, the value of 3x2 + 5x – 2 is zero when either 3x – 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,\nwhen x = 1\n3  or x = –2. So, the zeroes of 3x2 + 5x – 2 are 1\n3  and – 2.

For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 11 × 23, and so on.\nNow, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply\nsome or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).\nLet us list a few :\n7 × 11 × 23 = 1771\n3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 5313\n2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 10626\n23 × 3 × 73 = 8232\n22 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 21252\nand so on.\nNow, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.\nWhat is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite\nnumber of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,\nif we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite\ncollection of numbers, all\nthe primes and all possible\nproducts of primes. The\nquestion is – can we\nproduce all the composite\nnumbers this way? What\ndo you think? Do you\nthink that there may be a\ncomposite number which\nis not the product of\npowers\nof\nprimes?\nBefore we answer this,\nlet us factorise positive\nintegers, that is, do the\nopposite of what we have\ndone so far.\nWe are going to use\nthe factor tree with which\nyou are all familiar.

Let us see what the graph* of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 looks like. Let us list  a few values of y = x2 – 3x – 4 corresponding to\na few values for x as given in Table 2.1.\n* Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students,\nnor is to be evaluated.\nFig. 2.1\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n13\nTable 2.1\nx\n– 2\n–1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\ny = x2 – 3x – 4\n6\n0\n– 4\n– 6\n– 6\n– 4\n0\n6\nIf we locate the points listed\nabove on a graph paper and draw\nthe graph, it will actually look like\nthe one given in Fig. 2.2.\nIn fact, for any quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the\ngraph of the corresponding\nequation y = ax2 + bx + c has one\nof the two shapes either open\nupwards like\nor open\ndownwards like\ndepending on\nwhether a > 0 or a < 0. (These\ncurves are called parabolas.)\nYou can see from Table 2.1\nthat –1 and 4 are zeroes of the\nquadratic polynomial. Also\nnote from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4\nare the x-coordinates of the points\nwhere the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4\nintersects the x-axis. Thus, the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nx2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of\nthe points where the graph of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 intersects the\nx-axis.\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the\nparabola representing  y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the\nfollowing three cases can happen:\nFig. 2.2\nReprint 2025-26\n14\nMATHEMATICS\nCase (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A.\nThe x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nax2 + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\nFig. 2.3\nCase (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident\npoints. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A\n(see Fig. 2.4).\nFig. 2.4\nThe x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c\nin this case.\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n15\nCase (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below\nthe x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\nFig. 2.5\nSo, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero in this case.\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two\ndistinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a\npolynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.\nNow, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic\npolynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. To see what\nthe graph of y = x3 – 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few\nvalues for x as shown in Table 2.2.\nTable 2.2\nx\n–2\n–1\n0\n1\n2\ny = x3 – 4x\n0\n3\n0\n–3\n0\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see\nthat the graph of y = x3 – 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\nReprint 2025-26\n16\nMATHEMATICS\nWe see from the table above\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the\ncubic polynomial x3 – 4x. Observe\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the\nx-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – 4x\nintersects the x-axis. Since the curve\nmeets the x-axis in only these 3\npoints, their x-coordinates are the\nonly zeroes of the polynomial.\nLet us take a few more\nexamples. Consider the cubic\npolynomials x3 and x3 – x2. We draw\nthe graphs of y = x3 and y = x3 – x2\nin Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.\nFig. 2.7\nFig. 2.8\nFig. 2.6\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n17\nNote that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x3. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see\nthat 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the\nx-axis. Similarly, since x3 – x2 = x2 (x – 1),  0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial\nx3 – x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – x2 intersects the x-axis.\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic\npolynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\nRemark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)\nintersects the x-axis at atmost n points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has\nat most n zeroes.",

We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)\n= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2x2 – 8x + 6 are 1 and 3.

By the\nmethod of splitting the middle term,\n3x2 + 5x – 2 = 3x2 + 6x – x – 2 = 3x(x + 2) –1(x + 2)\n= (3x – 1)(x + 2)\nHence, the value of 3x2 + 5x – 2 is zero when either 3x – 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,\nwhen x = 1\n3  or x = –2. So, the zeroes of 3x2 + 5x – 2 are 1\n3  and – 2.

If each ride costs\n` 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ` 4, how would you find out the number of rides she\nhad and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ` 20.\nMay be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it\npossible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge\nof Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.\nPAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS\nIN TWO VARIABLES\nReprint 2025-26\nPAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES\n25\nLet us try this approach.\nDenote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she\nplayed Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:\ny = 1\n2 x\n(1)\n3x + 4y = 20\n(2)\nCan we find the solutions of this pair of equations?

Let us try\nanother number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 32 × 3803 × 3607. Of course,\nyou have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural\nnumbers yourself.)   This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be\nwritten as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance\nto the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.\nTheorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite\nnumber can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation\nis unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can\nbe factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any\ncomposite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’\nway, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite\nnumber there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we",

Let us see what the graph* of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 looks like. Let us list  a few values of y = x2 – 3x – 4 corresponding to\na few values for x as given in Table 2.1.\n* Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students,\nnor is to be evaluated.\nFig. 2.1\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n13\nTable 2.1\nx\n– 2\n–1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\ny = x2 – 3x – 4\n6\n0\n– 4\n– 6\n– 6\n– 4\n0\n6\nIf we locate the points listed\nabove on a graph paper and draw\nthe graph, it will actually look like\nthe one given in Fig. 2.2.\nIn fact, for any quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the\ngraph of the corresponding\nequation y = ax2 + bx + c has one\nof the two shapes either open\nupwards like\nor open\ndownwards like\ndepending on\nwhether a > 0 or a < 0. (These\ncurves are called parabolas.)\nYou can see from Table 2.1\nthat –1 and 4 are zeroes of the\nquadratic polynomial. Also\nnote from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4\nare the x-coordinates of the points\nwhere the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4\nintersects the x-axis. Thus, the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nx2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of\nthe points where the graph of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 intersects the\nx-axis.\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the\nparabola representing  y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the\nfollowing three cases can happen:\nFig. 2.2\nReprint 2025-26\n14\nMATHEMATICS\nCase (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A.\nThe x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nax2 + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\nFig. 2.3\nCase (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident\npoints. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A\n(see Fig. 2.4).\nFig. 2.4\nThe x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c\nin this case.\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n15\nCase (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below\nthe x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\nFig. 2.5\nSo, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero in this case.\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two\ndistinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a\npolynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.\nNow, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic\npolynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. To see what\nthe graph of y = x3 – 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few\nvalues for x as shown in Table 2.2.\nTable 2.2\nx\n–2\n–1\n0\n1\n2\ny = x3 – 4x\n0\n3\n0\n–3\n0\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see\nthat the graph of y = x3 – 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\nReprint 2025-26\n16\nMATHEMATICS\nWe see from the table above\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the\ncubic polynomial x3 – 4x.

Since the curve\nmeets the x-axis in only these 3\npoints, their x-coordinates are the\nonly zeroes of the polynomial.\nLet us take a few more\nexamples.

Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see\nthat 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the\nx-axis. Similarly, since x3 – x2 = x2 (x – 1),  0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial\nx3 – x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – x2 intersects the x-axis.\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic\npolynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\nRemark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)\nintersects the x-axis at atmost n points.

Similarly, p(0) is the value of\np(x) at x = 0, which is – 4.\nIf p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by\nreplacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k).\nWhat is the value of p(x) = x2 –3x – 4 at x = –1? We have :\np(–1) = (–1)2 –{3 × (–1)} – 4 = 0\nAlso, note that\np(4) = 42 – (3  4) – 4 = 0.\nAs p(–1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, –1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic\npolynomial x2 – 3x – 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a\npolynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0.\nYou have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear",

We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)\n= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2x2 – 8x + 6 are 1 and 3.

By the\nmethod of splitting the middle term,\n3x2 + 5x – 2 = 3x2 + 6x – x – 2 = 3x(x + 2) –1(x + 2)\n= (3x – 1)(x + 2)\nHence, the value of 3x2 + 5x – 2 is zero when either 3x – 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,\nwhen x = 1\n3  or x = –2. So, the zeroes of 3x2 + 5x – 2 are 1\n3  and – 2.

We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)\n= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3.

We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)\n= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3.

We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)\n= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3.

A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a\nconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has\ninfinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of\nlinear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is\nalways consistent.\nWe can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations\nin two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:\n(i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations\nhas a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).\n(ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution\n(inconsistent pair of equations).\n(iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many\nsolutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].\nConsider the following three pairs of equations.\n(i) x – 2y = 0 and 3x + 4y – 20 = 0\n(The lines intersect)\n(ii) 2x + 3y – 9 = 0 and 4x + 6y – 18 = 0\n(The lines coincide)\n(iii) x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0\n(The lines are parallel)\nLet us now write down, and compare, the values of\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n,\nand\na\nb\nc\nc\na\nb\nin all the\nthree examples.

In this case, the pair of equations is dependent\n(consistent).\n(iii) If the lines are parallel, then the pair of equations has no solution. In this case, the\npair of equations is inconsistent.\n3.

We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)\n= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3.

A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a\nconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has\ninfinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of\nlinear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is\nalways consistent.\nWe can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations\nin two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:\n(i) the lines may intersect in a single point.

That is, can any\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply\nsome or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).\nLet us list a few :\n7 × 11 × 23 = 1771\n3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 5313\n2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 10626\n23 × 3 × 73 = 8232\n22 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 21252\nand so on.\nNow, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.\nWhat is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite\nnumber of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,\nif we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite\ncollection of numbers, all\nthe primes and all possible\nproducts of primes.

Let us see what the graph* of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 looks like. Let us list  a few values of y = x2 – 3x – 4 corresponding to\na few values for x as given in Table 2.1.\n* Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students,\nnor is to be evaluated.\nFig. 2.1\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n13\nTable 2.1\nx\n– 2\n–1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\ny = x2 – 3x – 4\n6\n0\n– 4\n– 6\n– 6\n– 4\n0\n6\nIf we locate the points listed\nabove on a graph paper and draw\nthe graph, it will actually look like\nthe one given in Fig. 2.2.\nIn fact, for any quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the\ngraph of the corresponding\nequation y = ax2 + bx + c has one\nof the two shapes either open\nupwards like\nor open\ndownwards like\ndepending on\nwhether a > 0 or a < 0.

Also\nnote from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4\nare the x-coordinates of the points\nwhere the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4\nintersects the x-axis. Thus, the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nx2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of\nthe points where the graph of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 intersects the\nx-axis.\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the\nparabola representing  y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the\nfollowing three cases can happen:\nFig. 2.2\nReprint 2025-26\n14\nMATHEMATICS\nCase (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A.\nThe x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nax2 + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\nFig. 2.3\nCase (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident\npoints. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A\n(see Fig. 2.4).\nFig. 2.4\nThe x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c\nin this case.\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS\n15\nCase (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below\nthe x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\nFig. 2.5\nSo, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero in this case.\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two\ndistinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a\npolynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.\nNow, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic\npolynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. To see what\nthe graph of y = x3 – 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few\nvalues for x as shown in Table 2.2.\nTable 2.2\nx\n–2\n–1\n0\n1\n2\ny = x3 – 4x\n0\n3\n0\n–3\n0\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see\nthat the graph of y = x3 – 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\nReprint 2025-26\n16\nMATHEMATICS\nWe see from the table above\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the\ncubic polynomial x3 – 4x.

Since the curve\nmeets the x-axis in only these 3\npoints, their x-coordinates are the\nonly zeroes of the polynomial.\nLet us take a few more\nexamples.

Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see\nthat 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the\nx-axis. Similarly, since x3 – x2 = x2 (x – 1),  0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial\nx3 – x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – x2 intersects the x-axis.\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic\npolynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\nRemark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)\nintersects the x-axis at atmost n points.
