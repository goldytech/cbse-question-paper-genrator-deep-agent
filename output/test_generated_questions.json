If the graph is tangent to the x-axis at a zero, that zero has even multiplicity (typically 2).\n\nThe graph intersects (crosses) the x-axis at x = -1, so factor (x + 1) must appear with odd multiplicity (1). The graph is tangent at x = 2, so factor (x - 2) must appear with even multiplicity (2). Thus the polynomial (up to a constant factor) must be (x + 1)(x - 2)^2, which is option A.\n\nWhy the others are wrong:\n- B: (x + 1)^2(x - 2) has (x + 1) of multiplicity 2 (tangent at -1) and (x - 2) of multiplicity 1 (crossing at 2), opposite to the given behaviour.\n- C: (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 3) has simple factors only, so the graph would cross at x = -1 and x = 2 (not be tangent at x = 2); also it introduces an extra zero at x = -3.\n- D: (x - 2)^3 has only x = 2 as a zero (multiplicity 3), so there is no zero at x = -1 as required.",

          "explanation": "Solution:\nStep 1: Interpret the problem. We need the least positive time T such that T is a common multiple of 72, 90 and 150. That is, T = LCM(72, 90, 150).\n\nStep 2: Prime factorise each number (use Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to write each as product of primes):\n72 = 2^3 × 3^2  (since 72 = 8 × 9)\n90 = 2 × 3^2 × 5  (since 90 = 2 × 9 × 5)\n150 = 2 × 3 × 5^2  (since 150 = 2 × 3 × 25)\n\nStep 3: To form a common multiple we must include the primes 2, 3 and 5 with exponents at least as large as those appearing in each factorisation. For the least common multiple we take the highest exponent of each prime that appears among the three factorizations:\n- Highest power of 2 is 2^3 (from 72)\n- Highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 72 and 90)\n- Highest power of 5 is 5^2 (from 150)\n\nSo LCM(72, 90, 150) = 2^3 × 3^2 × 5^2.\n\nStep 4: Compute the LCM numerically:\n2^3 × 3^2 × 5^2 = 8 × 9 × 25 = 72 × 25 = 1800.\n\nTherefore (a) all three machines will next start together after 1800 seconds. Converting to minutes: 1800 s = 30 minutes.\n\nStep 5: Justification using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA):\nBy FTA each of the three numbers has a unique prime-power factorisation. Any common multiple T must, when prime-factorised, contain each prime 2, 3 and 5 with exponent greater than or equal to the exponent appearing in the factorisation of each of the three numbers. To get the least such T we must choose for each prime the maximum exponent that occurs among the three numbers. The number obtained in this way is unique and equals 2^3×3^2×5^2 = 1800. Hence 1800 is the least positive common multiple and thus the least positive time when all three machines start together. This conclusion directly follows from uniqueness of prime factorisation guaranteed by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nAnswer: (a) 1800 seconds (b) Justified above using FTA; 1800 is the least such time.",
