(b) Using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, justify why your answer is the least positive time when they all start together.",

      "correct_answer": null,
      "explanation": "Solution:\nStep 1: Interpret the problem. We need the least positive time T such that T is a common multiple of 72, 90 and 150. That is, T = LCM(72, 90, 150).\n\nStep 2: Prime factorise each number (use Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to write each as product of primes):\n72 = 2^3 \u00d7 3^2  (since 72 = 8 \u00d7 9)\n90 = 2 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5  (since 90 = 2 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5)\n150 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5^2  (since 150 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 25)\n\nStep 3: To form a common multiple we must include the primes 2, 3 and 5 with exponents at least as large as those appearing in each factorisation. For the least common multiple we take the highest exponent of each prime that appears among the three factorizations:\n- Highest power of 2 is 2^3 (from 72)\n- Highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 72 and 90)\n- Highest power of 5 is 5^2 (from 150)\n\nSo LCM(72, 90, 150) = 2^3 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5^2.\n\nStep 4: Compute the LCM numerically:\n2^3 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5^2 = 8 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 25 = 72 \u00d7 25 = 1800.\n\nTherefore (a) all three machines will next start together after 1800 seconds. Converting to minutes: 1800 s = 30 minutes.\n\nStep 5: Justification using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA):\nBy FTA each of the three numbers has a unique prime-power factorisation. Any common multiple T must, when prime-factorised, contain each prime 2, 3 and 5 with exponent greater than or equal to the exponent appearing in the factorisation of each of the three numbers. To get the least such T we must choose for each prime the maximum exponent that occurs among the three numbers. The number obtained in this way is unique and equals 2^3\u00d73^2\u00d75^2 = 1800. Hence 1800 is the least positive common multiple and thus the least positive time when all three machines start together. This conclusion directly follows from uniqueness of prime factorisation guaranteed by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nAnswer: (a) 1800 seconds (b) Justified above using FTA; 1800 is the least such time.",
