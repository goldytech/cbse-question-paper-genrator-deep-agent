## SECTION A: MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS (1 mark each)

### Question A-1 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Real Numbers - The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Quality Score:** 0.95/1.00

**Question:**
Which of the following is the correct prime factorisation of 360 (expressed as product of powers of primes)?

A) 2³ × 3² × 5  
B) 2² × 3² × 5  
C) 2³ × 3 × 5²  
D) 2⁴ × 3² × 5

**Correct Answer:** A

**Detailed Solution:**
Factorise 360 by dividing by the smallest prime repeatedly:
- 360 ÷ 2 = 180
- 180 ÷ 2 = 90
- 90 ÷ 2 = 45 (so we have three 2's → 2³)
- 45 ÷ 3 = 15
- 15 ÷ 3 = 5 (two 3's → 3²)
- Remaining factor is 5.

Hence 360 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 2³ × 3² × 5, which is option A.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- B) 2² × 3² × 5 = 4 × 9 × 5 = 180, not 360 (one 2 is missing)
- C) 2³ × 3 × 5² = 8 × 3 × 25 = 600, not 360 (exponents of 3 and 5 incorrect)
- D) 2⁴ × 3² × 5 = 16 × 9 × 5 = 720, not 360 (one extra 2)

By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the prime factorisation (up to order) is unique, so A is the only correct representation.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Divide 360 repeatedly by the smallest prime (start with 2) until you reach 1.
2. Count how many times each prime divides 360 to get the exponents.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Knowledge of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, ...)
- Ability to perform repeated division and multiplication
- Understanding that prime factorisation is unique (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Stopping factorisation too early (not factoring the remaining composite factor)
- Miscounting the number of times a prime divides the number (wrong exponents)
- Confusing 1 or composite numbers as primes when listing factors

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
This is an excellent fundamental question testing the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The distractors are well-designed to test common errors students make when factorising. The explanation is thorough and step-by-step. Suitable for testing basic recall and application.

### Question A-2 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Polynomials - Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Quality Score:** 0.98/1.00

**Question:**
Which of the following correctly states the geometrical meaning of a zero of a polynomial p(x)?

A) The x-coordinate of a point where the graph of y = p(x) intersects the x-axis.  
B) The y-coordinate of a point where the graph of y = p(x) intersects the y-axis.  
C) The slope of the graph y = p(x) at x = 0.  
D) The x-coordinate of a point where the graph of y = p(x) is maximum or minimum.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Detailed Solution:**
A real number k is a zero of p(x) if p(k) = 0. On the graph y = p(x), the point corresponding to x = k is (k, p(k)) = (k, 0). Hence k is the x-coordinate of a point where the graph meets the x-axis.

Options B, C and D are incorrect:
- B describes the y-intercept (occurring when x = 0)
- C refers to the slope (derivative) at x = 0 which is unrelated to zeros in general
- D describes extrema (maxima/minima), which need not satisfy p(x) = 0

**Hints for Students:**
1. Remember: k is a zero of p(x) exactly when p(k) = 0.
2. On the graph y = p(x), replace p(k) by 0 to find the corresponding point (k, 0).

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Definition of a zero/root of a polynomial (p(k) = 0)
- Basic understanding of Cartesian coordinates and graphing (x- and y-axes)

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Confusing zero of the polynomial with y-intercept (value at x = 0)
- Thinking a zero is the y-coordinate instead of the x-coordinate of the x-axis intersection

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Excellent conceptual question testing the fundamental understanding of polynomial zeros. The distractors systematically test different misconceptions students have about graph terminology. High quality with clear, concise explanation. Perfect for testing conceptual understanding.

### Question A-3 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables - Graphical Method of Solution  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Quality Score:** 0.95/1.00

**Question:**
Consider the pair of linear equations 2x + 3y - 6 = 0 and 4x + 6y - 12 = 0. Using the graphical method criteria, what is the nature of the pair?

A) The lines intersect in a single point (unique solution)  
B) The lines are coincident (infinitely many solutions)  
C) The lines are parallel (no solution)  
D) Cannot be determined from the given information

**Correct Answer:** B

**Detailed Solution:**
Compare the ratios of coefficients for the two equations written as a₁x + b₁y + c₁ = 0 and a₂x + b₂y + c₂ = 0.

Here:
- a₁/a₂ = 2/4 = 1/2
- b₁/b₂ = 3/6 = 1/2
- c₁/c₂ = (−6)/(−12) = 1/2

Since a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ = c₁/c₂, the two lines are coincident, so the pair has infinitely many solutions.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- A is wrong because for intersecting lines a₁/a₂ ≠ b₁/b₂
- C is wrong because for parallel lines a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ but a₁/a₂ ≠ c₁/c₂; here c ratios also match
- D is wrong because the ratios of coefficients give a definite classification

**Hints for Students:**
1. Write each equation in the form a x + b y + c = 0 and compute a₁/a₂, b₁/b₂ and c₁/c₂.
2. If all three ratios are equal, the lines are coincident (infinitely many solutions).

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Form of a linear equation in two variables: ax + by + c = 0
- Knowledge of ratio conditions for intersecting, parallel and coincident lines

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Forgetting to include the constant term c when comparing ratios
- Sign errors when computing c₁/c₂ (negatives)
- Confusing parallel (no solution) with coincident (infinitely many solutions) when a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Good question testing the ratio conditions for classifying pairs of linear equations. The second equation is exactly double the first, making this a clear coincident lines case. Well-designed distractors test common errors in applying the ratio test. Excellent for testing understanding of graphical method criteria.

### Question A-4 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Real Numbers - The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
Find the prime factorisation (expressed as product of powers of primes in ascending order) of 2310.

A) 2310 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11  
B) 2310 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 11 × 13  
C) 2310 = 2 × 3² × 5 × 7  
D) 2310 = 2 × 5 × 7 × 33

**Correct Answer:** A

**Detailed Solution:**
Divide 2310 by the smallest primes successively:
- 2310 ÷ 2 = 1155
- 1155 ÷ 3 = 385
- 385 ÷ 5 = 77
- 77 ÷ 7 = 11
- 11 ÷ 11 = 1

Thus the prime factors are 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. Writing as product of powers (and in ascending order) gives 2310 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- B) Replaces 7 by 13; 2×3×5×11×13 = 4290, not 2310
- C) Uses 3² (i.e. 9) instead of 3; 2×3²×5×7 = 2×9×5×7 = 630, not 2310
- D) Although 2×5×7×33 = 2310 numerically, 33 is composite (33 = 3×11). The question asks for prime factorisation (product of primes), so representing with a composite factor is not a correct prime factorisation. The unique prime factorisation is A.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Use repeated division by the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, ...).
2. Stop when the quotient becomes 1; then write all prime divisors in ascending order.
3. If a prime repeats, combine repeats as a power (for example, 2×2×2 = 2³).

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Definition of prime and composite numbers
- Technique of dividing by small primes to factorise a number
- Understanding product of powers notation for repeated prime factors

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Including a composite factor (like 33) instead of breaking it into primes
- Using incorrect exponents for repeated primes (e.g., 3² instead of 3)
- Replacing a correct prime with another prime (typo or misdivision) leading to wrong product

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Excellent question testing prime factorisation skills with a number (2310) that uses 5 distinct primes. Option D is particularly clever as it tests whether students understand that ALL factors must be prime (not just the product being correct). High quality with comprehensive explanation and good distractors.

### Question A-5 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Polynomials - Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
The graph of a cubic polynomial y = p(x) intersects the x-axis at x = -1 and is tangent to the x-axis at x = 2. Which of the following polynomials (up to a non-zero constant factor) could be p(x)?

A) (x + 1)(x - 2)²  
B) (x + 1)²(x - 2)  
C) (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 3)  
D) (x - 2)³

**Correct Answer:** A

**Detailed Solution:**
A zero of p(x) is an x-coordinate where the graph meets the x-axis. If the graph crosses the x-axis at a zero, that zero has odd multiplicity (typically 1). If the graph is tangent to the x-axis at a zero, that zero has even multiplicity (typically 2).

The graph intersects (crosses) the x-axis at x = -1, so factor (x + 1) must appear with odd multiplicity (1). The graph is tangent at x = 2, so factor (x - 2) must appear with even multiplicity (2). Thus the polynomial (up to a constant factor) must be (x + 1)(x - 2)², which is option A.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- B: (x + 1)²(x - 2) has (x + 1) of multiplicity 2 (tangent at -1) and (x - 2) of multiplicity 1 (crossing at 2), opposite to the given behaviour.
- C: (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 3) has simple factors only, so the graph would cross at x = -1 and x = 2 (not be tangent at x = 2); also it introduces an extra zero at x = -3.
- D: (x - 2)³ has only x = 2 as a zero (multiplicity 3), so there is no zero at x = -1 as required.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Remember: zeros are x-values where p(x) = 0 (x-intercepts).
2. Even multiplicity of a factor makes the graph touch (be tangent to) the x-axis; odd multiplicity makes it cross.
3. Choose factors (x + 1) and (x - 2) with multiplicities matching the described behaviour.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Definition of zero of a polynomial (p(k) = 0)
- Factor (x - a) corresponds to zero at x = a
- Effect of factor multiplicity on whether graph crosses or is tangent to the x-axis

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Assuming tangency means multiplicity 1 (mixing up touch vs cross)
- Forgetting that a constant multiple does not change zeros
- Selecting a polynomial that introduces extra zeros not described in the graph

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Excellent higher-order thinking question testing understanding of zero multiplicity and its graphical interpretation. This is a conceptually advanced question suitable for medium difficulty. The distractors systematically test different aspects of understanding multiplicity. Well-designed question that requires students to integrate geometric information with algebraic form.

### Question A-6 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables - Graphical Method of Solution  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
For the pair of linear equations 4x + 6y - 8 = 0 and 2x + 3y - 5 = 0, the lines representing them are:

A) Coincident lines (infinitely many solutions)  
B) Parallel lines (no solution)  
C) Intersecting lines (unique solution)  
D) Cannot be determined from the given information

**Correct Answer:** B

**Detailed Solution:**
Write coefficients: a₁=4, b₁=6, c₁=-8 and a₂=2, b₂=3, c₂=-5.

Compute ratios:
- a₁/a₂ = 4/2 = 2
- b₁/b₂ = 6/3 = 2
- c₁/c₂ = (-8)/(-5) = 8/5 = 1.6

Here a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ but a₁/a₂ ≠ c₁/c₂. According to the criterion, if a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂ the lines are parallel and the pair is inconsistent (no solution). Therefore option B is correct.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- A is wrong because coincident lines require a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ = c₁/c₂ (all three ratios equal), which is not true here
- C is wrong because intersecting lines occur when a₁/a₂ ≠ b₁/b₂; here they are equal
- D is wrong because the nature of the pair can be determined using the ratio test shown above

**Hints for Students:**
1. Compare the ratios a₁/a₂, b₁/b₂ and c₁/c₂ for the two equations in the form ax + by + c = 0.
2. If a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ but not equal to c₁/c₂, the lines are parallel (no solution).

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Know the general form of a line ax + by + c = 0 and identify a, b, c
- Recall the ratio test: compare a₁/a₂, b₁/b₂ and c₁/c₂ to decide relations between two lines

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Forgetting the signs of c₁ and c₂ when computing c₁/c₂
- Concluding coincident lines merely because a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ (without checking c₁/c₂)
- Computational errors in simplifying ratios (e.g., simplifying 4/2 and 6/3 incorrectly)

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Good question testing the parallel lines condition (a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂). The second equation has coefficients exactly half of the first for x and y terms, but not for the constant term. This creates a clear parallel lines case. Well-designed to test careful attention to all three ratios. Solid medium difficulty question.

### Question B-1 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Real Numbers - Revisiting Irrational Numbers  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
If √3 is irrational, determine whether √3 + 1 is rational or irrational. Give a brief justification.

**Detailed Solution:**
Assume, to the contrary, that √3 + 1 is rational. Since 1 is rational, subtracting 1 from the assumed rational number gives √3 = (√3 + 1) − 1, which would be rational. This contradicts the given fact that √3 is irrational. Hence √3 + 1 is irrational.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Use a proof by contradiction: assume √3 + 1 is rational.
2. Subtract 1 (a rational number) and use that the difference of two rationals is rational.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Definition of rational and irrational numbers
- Property: difference of two rationals is rational
- Basic algebraic manipulation (addition/subtraction)

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Assuming that adding 1 to an irrational could produce a rational without justification
- Forgetting to use the contradiction that subtracting a rational from a rational yields a rational
- Confusing irrational + irrational and rational + irrational properties

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Excellent question testing understanding of closure properties of rational and irrational numbers. The proof by contradiction method is clearly demonstrated. This is a standard CBSE question type that tests conceptual understanding rather than just computation. Well-explained with good identification of common mistakes.

### Question B-2 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Polynomials - Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Quality Score:** 0.95/1.00

**Question:**
The zeroes of the quadratic polynomial p(x) = ax² + bx + c are 3 and −2. If a = 2, find b and c, and hence write the polynomial p(x).

**Detailed Solution:**
Let the zeroes be α = 3 and β = −2.

Sum of zeroes: α + β = 3 + (−2) = 1
Using α + β = −b/a, we get −b/2 = 1 ⇒ b = −2.

Product of zeroes: αβ = 3 × (−2) = −6
Using αβ = c/a, we get c/2 = −6 ⇒ c = −12.

Hence the polynomial is p(x) = 2x² − 2x − 12 (which factors as 2(x − 3)(x + 2)).

**Hints for Students:**
1. Use sum of zeroes α + β = −b/a to find b.
2. Use product of zeroes αβ = c/a to find c.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Formulae for sum and product of zeroes of ax² + bx + c: α + β = −b/a, αβ = c/a
- Basic algebraic substitution and solving linear equations

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Forgetting the negative sign in the relation α + β = −b/a and getting the sign of b wrong
- Incorrectly computing the product sign (e.g., treating −6 as +6)

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Good straightforward application question testing the relationship between zeroes and coefficients. Students must work backwards from given zeroes to find coefficients. Clear solution with verification showing the polynomial factors correctly. Appropriate difficulty for 2 marks.

### Question B-3 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables - Algebraic Methods of Solving a Pair of Linear Equations  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
Solve the following pair of linear equations by the substitution method and state the solution (x, y): 4x + 3y = 11 and x − 2y = 5.

**Detailed Solution:**
From x − 2y = 5, express x in terms of y: x = 5 + 2y.

Substitute into 4x + 3y = 11:
4(5 + 2y) + 3y = 11
⇒ 20 + 8y + 3y = 11
⇒ 11y = 11 − 20 = −9
⇒ y = −9/11

Now x = 5 + 2y = 5 + 2(−9/11) = 5 − 18/11 = (55/11 − 18/11) = 37/11.

Therefore the solution is (x, y) = (37/11, −9/11). You can verify by substituting these values into both equations.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Write one variable in terms of the other using one equation (e.g., x = 5 + 2y).
2. Substitute this expression into the other equation to obtain an equation in one variable, then solve.
3. Carefully simplify fractional results and substitute back to find the other variable.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Understanding of the substitution method for solving linear equations
- Ability to solve linear equations involving fractions
- Basic algebraic manipulation (expanding and simplifying)

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Sign errors when substituting (e.g., mishandling −2y)
- Arithmetic mistakes while expanding or combining like terms
- Incorrect simplification of fractions when finding x after y

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Good substitution method question with fractional answers, testing students' algebraic manipulation skills. The solution results in fractional coordinates which requires careful arithmetic. Well-explained with clear step-by-step working. Appropriate for medium difficulty level.

### Question B-4 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Real Numbers - Revisiting Irrational Numbers  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
Prove that √5 is irrational.

**Detailed Solution:**
Assume, to the contrary, that √5 is rational. Then √5 = a/b for some integers a, b (b ≠ 0). Cancel any common factor so that gcd(a, b) = 1. Squaring both sides gives 5b² = a². Hence a² is divisible by 5, and by the property of primes, a is divisible by 5. Let a = 5k for some integer k. Substituting gives 5b² = 25k² ⇒ b² = 5k². Thus b² is divisible by 5, so b is divisible by 5. Therefore a and b have 5 as a common factor, contradicting gcd(a, b) = 1. This contradiction implies that our assumption is false; hence √5 is irrational.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Assume √5 is rational and express it as a/b in lowest terms.
2. Square both sides to get an equation involving a² and b².
3. Use the fact that if a prime p divides a² then p divides a.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Definition of rational and irrational numbers
- Divisibility properties and prime divisors (if p divides a² then p divides a)

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Not assuming a and b are coprime before reaching a contradiction
- Incorrectly concluding from a² divisible by 5 that a² = 5 (instead of a is divisible by 5)
- Forgetting to use the prime divisibility property and thus failing to obtain the contradiction

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
This is the standard proof of irrationality for square roots, specifically √5. The solution follows the classic proof by contradiction structure perfectly. Clear, rigorous, and complete. Identifies common student errors accurately. This is exactly what CBSE expects for this topic. Excellent question.

### Question B-5 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Polynomials - Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Quality Score:** 0.94/1.00

**Question:**
For the quadratic polynomial 6x² - kx + 8, one of its zeroes is 2/3. Find the value of k using the relationship between zeroes and coefficients.

**Detailed Solution:**
Let the zeroes be α = 2/3 and β.

For a quadratic ax² + bx + c, product of zeroes αβ = c/a.
Here a = 6 and c = 8, so αβ = 8/6 = 4/3.
Thus β = (4/3) ÷ (2/3) = 2.

Sum of zeroes: α + β = 2/3 + 2 = 8/3.

For the polynomial 6x² - kx + 8, b = -k, so sum = -b/a = -(-k)/6 = k/6.
Therefore k/6 = 8/3 ⇒ k = 6 × 8/3 = 16.

(Check: with k = 16, polynomial is 6x² - 16x + 8; dividing by 2 gives 3x² - 8x + 4 = 3(x - 2/3)(x - 2), zeros 2/3 and 2.)

**Hints for Students:**
1. Use product of zeroes αβ = c/a to find the other zero.
2. Then use sum of zeroes α + β = -b/a to determine k.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Relation between zeros and coefficients of a quadratic: α + β = -b/a, αβ = c/a
- Basic fraction arithmetic and solving linear equations

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Treating b as k instead of b = -k for the polynomial 6x² - kx + 8
- Arithmetic errors when dividing fractions while finding the other zero
- Forgetting to use αβ = c/a and attempting to substitute directly into the polynomial without simplifying

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Good hard difficulty question requiring students to work with fractional zeroes and find an unknown coefficient. Requires two-step reasoning: first find the other zero using product relation, then use sum relation to find k. The check at the end verifies the answer. Tests deeper understanding of zero-coefficient relationships.

## SECTION C: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS (3 marks each, attempt any 4)

### Question C-1 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Polynomials - Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
If α and β are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial 4x² − 4x + 1, find the value of α³ + β³ without finding α and β. (3 marks)

**Detailed Solution:**
**Step 1:** Compare 4x² − 4x + 1 with ax² + bx + c. So a = 4, b = −4, c = 1.

**Step 2:** Use the relations sum of zeroes α + β = −b/a and product αβ = c/a.
- α + β = −(−4)/4 = 4/4 = 1
- αβ = 1/4

**Step 3:** Use identity α³ + β³ = (α + β)³ − 3αβ(α + β).
Substitute values: α³ + β³ = (1)³ − 3·(1/4)·(1) = 1 − 3/4 = 1/4.

Therefore, α³ + β³ = 1/4.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Find α + β and αβ from the coefficients using α + β = −b/a and αβ = c/a.
2. Use the identity α³ + β³ = (α + β)³ − 3αβ(α + β).

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Relation between zeroes and coefficients of ax² + bx + c: α + β = −b/a, αβ = c/a
- Algebraic identity for sum of cubes: α³ + β³ = (α + β)³ − 3αβ(α + β)

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Forgetting the sign in α + β = −b/a (sign error when b is negative)
- Applying the wrong identity (e.g., using α³ + β³ = (α + β)³ without subtracting 3αβ(α + β))
- Arithmetic errors when simplifying fractions (especially with αβ = c/a)

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Excellent application question testing algebraic identities combined with polynomial zero relations. Students must recall and apply the sum of cubes identity. The polynomial 4x² − 4x + 1 = (2x-1)² has repeated roots at x = 1/2, but students don't need to find them explicitly. Well-structured with clear steps. Good 3-mark question.

**Topic:** Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables - Algebraic Methods of Solving a Pair of Linear Equations  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
A lending library has a fixed charge for the first three days and an additional charge for each day thereafter. Saritha paid ₹27 for a book she kept for seven days, while Susy paid ₹21 for a book she kept for five days. Form the pair of linear equations and find the fixed charge and the charge for each extra day.

**Detailed Solution:**
**Step 1:** Let F be the fixed charge for the first three days and d be the charge for each extra day.

**Step 2:** Express the total charges as equations.
- For 7 days, number of extra days = 7 − 3 = 4, so F + 4d = 27 ... (1)
- For 5 days, number of extra days = 5 − 3 = 2, so F + 2d = 21 ... (2)

**Step 3:** Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate F:
(F + 4d) − (F + 2d) = 27 − 21
⇒ 2d = 6
⇒ d = 3

**Step 4:** Substitute d = 3 into equation (2) to find F:
F + 2(3) = 21
⇒ F + 6 = 21
⇒ F = 15

**Answer:** The fixed charge is ₹15 and the charge for each extra day is ₹3.

**Verification:** For 7 days: 15 + 4×3 = 15 + 12 = 27 (matches). For 5 days: 15 + 2×3 = 21 (matches).

**Hints for Students:**
1. Assign variables for the fixed charge and the per-extra-day charge.
2. Write equations using number of extra days = total days − 3, then eliminate one variable by subtraction.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Forming linear equations from word problems
- Elimination (subtracting equations) to eliminate a variable
- Basic algebraic manipulation (substitution and solving linear equations)

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Using total days instead of extra days (forgetting to subtract the first 3 days)
- Arithmetic errors when subtracting the two equations
- Substituting wrong value back when finding the other variable

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Excellent real-world application question! This is a practical word problem that students can relate to (library charges). Tests ability to translate a word problem into mathematical equations and solve using elimination method. The verification step confirms the answer is correct. Good medium difficulty application question worth 3 marks.

### Question C-4 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Polynomials - Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Quality Score:** 0.96/1.00

**Question:**
Let α and β be the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial 2x² − 8x + k. If α² + β² = 7, find the value of k. (Show all steps.)

**Detailed Solution:**
Given polynomial: 2x² − 8x + k. Compare with ax² + bx + c: a = 2, b = −8, c = k.

**Step 1:** Sum of zeroes: α + β = −b/a = −(−8)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

**Step 2:** Product of zeroes: αβ = c/a = k/2.

**Step 3:** Use identity α² + β² = (α + β)² − 2αβ.
So α² + β² = (4)² − 2(k/2) = 16 − k.

**Step 4:** Given α² + β² = 7, therefore 16 − k = 7 ⇒ k = 16 − 7 = 9.

Hence k = 9, and the polynomial becomes 2x² − 8x + 9.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Write expressions for sum and product of zeroes in terms of a, b and c.
2. Use the identity α² + β² = (α + β)² − 2αβ and substitute the values.
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for k.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Sum and product of zeroes for ax² + bx + c: α + β = −b/a, αβ = c/a
- Algebraic identity: α² + β² = (α + β)² − 2αβ
- Basic algebraic manipulation and solving linear equations

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Using c instead of c/a for the product αβ (forgetting to divide by a)
- Applying the identity incorrectly as α² + β² = (α + β)² (omitting −2αβ)
- Arithmetic sign errors when computing −b/a

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
Good algebraic manipulation question requiring students to connect the given condition (α² + β² = 7) with the unknown coefficient k. Tests multiple concepts: zero-coefficient relations, algebraic identities, and solving linear equations. Well-structured solution with clear steps.

## SECTION D: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (5 marks each, attempt any 2)

### Question D-1 ✓ SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED
**Topic:** Real Numbers - The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Quality Score:** 0.97/1.00

**Question:**
Three machines in a factory start working simultaneously at time t = 0. Machine A completes a cycle every 72 seconds, Machine B every 90 seconds and Machine C every 150 seconds. 

(a) After how many seconds will all three machines next start a cycle together?
(b) Using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, justify why your answer is the least positive time when they all start together.

**Detailed Solution:**

**Step 1:** Interpret the problem.
We need the least positive time T such that T is a common multiple of 72, 90 and 150. That is, T = LCM(72, 90, 150).

**Step 2:** Prime factorise each number (use Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to write each as product of primes):
- 72 = 2³ × 3² (since 72 = 8 × 9)
- 90 = 2 × 3² × 5 (since 90 = 2 × 9 × 5)
- 150 = 2 × 3 × 5² (since 150 = 2 × 3 × 25)

**Step 3:** To form a common multiple we must include the primes 2, 3 and 5 with exponents at least as large as those appearing in each factorisation. For the least common multiple we take the highest exponent of each prime that appears among the three factorizations:
- Highest power of 2 is 2³ (from 72)
- Highest power of 3 is 3² (from 72 and 90)
- Highest power of 5 is 5² (from 150)

So LCM(72, 90, 150) = 2³ × 3² × 5².

**Step 4:** Compute the LCM numerically:
2³ × 3² × 5² = 8 × 9 × 25 = 72 × 25 = 1800.

Therefore (a) all three machines will next start together after 1800 seconds. Converting to minutes: 1800 s = 30 minutes.

**Step 5:** Justification using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA):
By FTA each of the three numbers has a unique prime-power factorisation. Any common multiple T must, when prime-factorised, contain each prime 2, 3 and 5 with exponent greater than or equal to the exponent appearing in the factorisation of each of the three numbers. To get the least such T we must choose for each prime the maximum exponent that occurs among the three numbers. The number obtained in this way is unique and equals 2³×3²×5² = 1800. Hence 1800 is the least positive common multiple and thus the least positive time when all three machines start together. This conclusion directly follows from uniqueness of prime factorisation guaranteed by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

**Answer:** (a) 1800 seconds (b) Justified above using FTA; 1800 is the least such time.

**Hints for Students:**
1. Prime-factorise each period (72, 90, 150) into powers of primes.
2. To find LCM take each prime with the highest exponent occurring among the numbers.
3. Use uniqueness of prime factorisation (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) to justify minimality.

**Prerequisites Students Should Know:**
- Understanding of prime numbers and prime factorisation
- Definition of LCM and how to compute it using prime powers
- Familiarity with the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (uniqueness of prime factorisation)

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**
- Taking the product of the numbers instead of the LCM (gives a much larger number)
- Not using the highest exponent for each prime (e.g., using 2¹ instead of 2³), leading to a smaller number that may not be a common multiple
- Arithmetic errors when multiplying the prime powers (e.g., incorrect multiplication of 8 × 9 × 25)

**Teacher Assessment Notes:**
EXCELLENT real-world application question! This is one of the best questions in the entire paper. It combines practical application (factory machines) with deep mathematical concepts (LCM and Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic). Part (b) specifically requires students to explain the theoretical justification, which tests higher-order thinking. The solution is thorough, well-structured, and mathematically rigorous. Perfect 5-mark question that exemplifies what CBSE aims to test.
